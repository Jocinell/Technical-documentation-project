                    The Apostle Paul, in Romans 10:8-10, shows us this simple, yet so powerful, principle of salvation. When you confess that Jesus is Lord of your life, believing in your heart that He died for you and God raised Him from the dead, that declaration or proclamation of your faith catapults you into the realms of salvation: “…if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation” (Romans 10:9-10).

                    The preceding verse 8 to Romans 10:9-10 that we read earlier says, “But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach.” If you don’t say it, salvation will never be activated, for salvation is activated by your confession; not the confession of sins, but your affirmation and declaration of the Lordship of Jesus Christ.

               <p> Why do we need to confess the Lordship of Jesus? It’s because when you proclaim His Lordship over your life, you’re instantly translated into His spiritual kingdom and given eternal life, righteousness, protection, and all of the inheritance of the sons of God in Christ. He becomes the shepherd of your life, leading and guiding you through His Word and His Holy Spirit given to all who receive Him. Amen.

                vents around the world point to the imminent return of our Lord Jesus Christ. They remind us of His words before He ascended to be with the Father in heaven that, “…there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places” (Matthew 24: 7) when His coming draws near. However, He said to His disciples, “…see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass…” (verse 6). New Testament believers are not to succumb to fear because of the prevailing circumstances to the point they forget the power and authority in the name of Jesus and who they are in Christ (Ephesians 2:6).

The supremacy and sufficiency of the name of Jesus is not limited to a particular country or continent, or to national and supranational boundaries. Everything on earth, underneath the earth, and in heaven, visible and invisible, is subject to the authority in the name of Jesus.

                    Christ is our perfect Example in all things. The Scripture says, “Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus” (Philippians 2:5). We are commanded to imbibe the attitude of Christ as we live and prepare for the coming of the Lord.

                <p>
                    he principle here is that we are to make Him our Model in all respects, and as far as possible, to frame our lives in accordance with His word. One, Christ “made himself of no reputation… he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death…” Humility should be the hallmark of every true believer.

No one can be said to be genuinely converted who is not like his Master in “lowliness of mind”, gentleness, meekness and selflessness.
